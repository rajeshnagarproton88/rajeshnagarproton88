Explanation:

Pipeline Declaration: Defines the beginning of a Jenkins Pipeline.
Agent: Specifies where the pipeline will run. any means any available Jenkins agent will do.
Stages: Divides the pipeline into logical sections.
Checkout Code: Fetches your project code from the Git repository. You'll need to replace 'https://your-git-repo-url.git' with your repository's actual URL.
Run Selenium Test: Executes the Selenium test.
sh Steps: These steps execute shell commands on the Jenkins agent:
Install Selenium if it's not already present.
Set the PATH environment variable so Jenkins can find ChromeDriver.
Run your Python Selenium test script (your_selenium_test_script.py) in headless mode. Make sure to replace this with the actual name of your script.
How to Use This Pipeline:

Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job:
Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
Click "New Item."
Enter a name for your job, select "Pipeline," and click "OK."
Configure the Pipeline:
In the Pipeline section, choose "Pipeline script from SCM" (if your Jenkinsfile is in your Git repository) or "Pipeline script" (if you want to paste the script directly).
If you chose "Pipeline script from SCM," specify your repository URL and the branch containing the Jenkinsfile.
Save the job configuration.
Run the Pipeline:
Click "Build Now" to trigger the pipeline.
Jenkins will checkout your code, install dependencies, and run the Selenium test in headless mode.
Important Tips:

Error Handling: Add try-catch blocks or post-build actions to handle test failures gracefully.
Reporting: Consider using Jenkins plugins (e.g., JUnit, TestNG) to publish test reports.
Notifications: Configure email or Slack notifications to alert you of build results.
Parallelization: For larger test suites, explore parallelizing your tests to speed up execution.
